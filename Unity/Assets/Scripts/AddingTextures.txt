Textures for the cells are stored in a 2D Texture Array in the textures folder.

In your favorite photo editor (I used photoshop, probably don't use paint), open the texture.
It's a grid of textures. Add your new texture to the grid and count how many textures are in a row and column.
Import it back to unity.
Make sure Texture Type is Default, Texture Shape is 2D Array, and Columns and Rows are set according to how many textures per row and column.

Make sure the material "Terrain" in the Shaders folder is set to use the new texture array.

At this point when you call hexGrid.ColorCell(hit.point, activeTexture), activeTexture is an index into the 2d texture array.
If you have a grid of textures such as:

t1 t2 t3
t4 t5

Then t1 is index 0, t2 is index 1, t3 is index 2, t4 is index 3, t5 is index 4, and so on if you have more.
